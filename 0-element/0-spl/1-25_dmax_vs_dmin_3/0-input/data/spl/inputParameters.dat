# Parameter for sample generation
Note:
-If iCompaction <>0 then before running rename sample.spl to InputSample.spl
-If iConfig <>0 then before running rename config.spl to InputConfig.spl

10 25									NClass (number of size classes), Nmin_pc (min number of particles per class)
.00012	3 							Dmin (minimum diameter)	SizeRatio (Dmax/Dmin)		
.0004		 							Dtopwall
0											iBetaFn (Flag for sensitivity analysis using cumulative beta distribution; 0: no sensitivity (default); 1: sensitivity
1 4.1 1 4.1						a_min,a_max,bmin,b_max for Beta function use in case of iBetaFunction=1
BetaFnSensitivity.out	outputFile to write the BetaFn Sensitivity in it
2 2										a and b parameters for the \beta function of prescribed analytical CVD curve (positive int)
25	25								Nx (Number of particles along x)	Ny (along y) 
0.1 									Gap (distance between particles lattice step = (1 + Gap)*Dmax) ; Gap>=0
0.45									Gap_imperfection (imperfection of particles locations on the lattice = (2*RAND - 1)*Gap*Dmax*Gamp_imperfection); 0<=RAND<=1; 0<=Gamp_imperfection<=0.5 with default value of 0.5
GradingCurveFile.dat	Grading curve - input file
ClassGradingCurveFile.out				Class Grading curve - output file
ClassSizeDistributionFile.out		Class Size distribution - output file
SampleBoxSize.spl								Size of SampleBox - output file
sample.spl						outputFile for sample
sample.gran						outputFile for sample only with diameters
config.spl						outputFile for config
0											iWall (Flag for the top wall definition using particles; 0: no top wall def. (default), 1: top wall def.)
0											iConfig (sample configuration); 0: for putting sample on a latice; 1: for reading config file (in this case Dmin will be ignored, and the dmax on top of Config file will be used together with the SizeRatio); 2: reading md_spl_000xxx.his and generate sample.spl (here Dmin and SizeRatio from the inputParameters.dat will be used)
InputConfig.spl				Sample configuration for case of iconfig=1 - input file for particle positions
md_spl_000061.his     Sample configuration for case of iconfig=2 - input file for particle positions
# Parameters for Monte Carlo Compaction

1.5	5000					  	DverFactor (x Dmin) and Nver for verlet list
0.90       						ROverlap: number of overlaps divided by total number of trials (if higher than this, Kd to be reduced)
1000000		1  					NMove & NStop: max number of trials before quitting the inner (# trials without halving Ld) and outer (# times halving Ld) loops
